# Self Evaluation for Reproducible Science

Inspired by the Joel Test and the Software Carpentry version of the Joel Test, 
this work is a checklist of attributes necessary for reproducible science. 
This checklist seeks to help scientists to answer the question: **How 
reproducible is my science?** At the end of the decision tree we seek to
provide something similar to a reproducible research badge for the scientist.

## Goals

1. Identify practices, rather than tools, characterizing reproducibility 
2. Based on these practices, place a study somewhere on the spectrum of
reproducibility
3. Clarify ambiguity among terminology (reproducibility, replicability, 
   repeatability, verifyability, etc.)
4. Establish domain-specific variance and criteria
5. Given placement on the spectrum, provide a set of recommendations for specific gaps.


## The Decision Tree

- [ ] If you use data, do you ever enter it by hand?
- [ ] Do you store your data in a database?
- [ ] If your laptop exploded, would your research be lost forever?
- [ ] Do you use version controlling for your software?
- [ ] Do you use version controlling for your data?
- [ ] Is your data available and freely accesible to your community?  // Fully,
  partially
- [ ] Is your code available and freely accesible to your community?
