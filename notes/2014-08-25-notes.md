# Notes from first reproducibility wg meeting  
(Phil, Karthik, and Fatma)  
_August 25th, 2014_

__Standardize vocabulary: What is reproducibility?__  

- Clarify ambuiguity surrounding terminology (reproducibility and repeatibility mean different things in different domains)
- Open science and reproducible research are often lumped together. While they share many common features, they are two separate areas.

__What makes a research study reproducible?__  

- Establish domain specific criteria to classify where a research study falls on the reproducibility spectrum (impossible to reproduce â†’  fully reproducible complete with full computing environment).   
- Can we establish a checklist that would place a study somewhere on this spectrum?  
- Can we establish a set of recommendations for each level (e..g incorporating version control and two other simple (kidding) steps will make your study more reproducible).   

__What are the incentives reproducibility?__

Research papers are merely advertisements for the real scholarship, which is often never shared (paraphrasing David Donoho). How do we incentivize good scientific practice over the current norm?

- Why would researchers take the time and effort to make their work reproducible when those activities are not recognized in academia? (ties into the careers and incentives wg). 
- Can we identify any progress on this front that might benefit researchers?
    + [Code as a research object](http://mozillascience.org/code-as-a-research-object-a-new-project/) (GitHub + Mozilla Science Lab)
    + [Altmetrics](http://altmetrics.org/manifesto/) (see ALM, and services like [ImpactStory](https://impactstory.org/))
    + Partnering with journals and badging papers (as evaluated by reviewers) that are minimally reproducible (something we could do).

__Identify training gaps__

- What skills do researchers need to make their existing work more reproducible? 
    + What skills do we teach early career researchers (who still have time to train) versus established researchers? Semester long courses versus workshops?
    + Can BIDS play a role in teaching these as a series of small workshops (e.g. version control as a separate workshop) (ties into training and curriculum wg)
  
__What are the software components in various scientific environments?__ 

- At least with the two major scientific programming environments (R and Python), can we identify tools and workflows that researchers can incorporate to make their work more reproducible (ties into the Software WG)
